## Required Dependencies

- **[Node Package Manager (npm)](https://nodejs.org/en/)** for Package Management. Check if `npm` was installed or not by opening the cmd/terminal and type in **`npm --version`**, you should see the version of `npm` you installed.
- After installing `npm`, we will install `typescript` and `ts-node` with the command **`npm i -g typescript ts-node`** in cmd/terminal. To check if the `typescript` was successfully installed, in the cmd/terminal, type in the command **`tsc --help`**, and you should see some output regarding typescript help. *NOTE: **`tsc`** stands for **`typescript compiler`***.
- [Download Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) as the editor as it has extensive typescript support.
